##### Hi, I'm Catherine Lucey, and welcome to my website! 

<img src="images/mia.jpeg" style="width:75%">

I am a first year PhD student in Environmental Health Sciences at the Columbia University Mailman School of Public Health. 


I can link to useful things like [google](https://www.google.com/) and [p8105](https://www.p8105.com/index.html)

you can make an extra page on your site and link to that witin the first page. 

Here's my [about](about.html).

you can link to the about.html file because you're working within the same repo

## Here's  picture

insert a picture here:

![](images/mia.jpeg)
OR

<img src="images/mia.jpeg" style="transform:rotate(90deg)">

this code is an example of how knowing a lil html is helpful (bc the above code is html, which rmd can understand)
